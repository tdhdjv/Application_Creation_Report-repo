and the video series tutorial that shows you how it was make this [https://youtu.be/lzI7QUyl66g?si=IwTMEEDTSy4p4mTL]

**What this Project has**
This project has collision detection using SAT(Seperating Axis Theorem) and RigidBody Collisions With Rotation
This project has a controllable box That is indicated by the color BLUE and is controlled with WASD
This project has a way to add bodies into scenes 
  LEFT CLICK = BOX
  RIGHT CLICK = CIRCLE  
This project has a camera (-, +)to Zoom in and out (up, down, left, right) keys to move the camera in the scene
